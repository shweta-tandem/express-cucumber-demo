# 🧪 Express + Cucumber BDD Demo

This is a **basic Express.js app** that showcases how to test your backend logic using **Cucumber**, a tool that allows writing test cases in plain English using the **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)** style.

## 🚀 What is this project?

This is a small demo where we:
- Create a **simple Express server**
- Add a dummy **login API**
- Test the login using **Cucumber**, which uses Given/When/Then steps like:
  - "Given a user enters email and password"
  - "When they submit login"
  - "Then they should see success message"

The idea is to **test logic using real-world behavior**, not just technical conditions.
